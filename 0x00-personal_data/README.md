# Project Findings
-PII includes more than just obvious data – Things like IP addresses and location data can also be considered PII depending on context and laws.

-Log filters can automatically mask sensitive data – Custom filters can detect and obfuscate PII in logs, reducing the risk of data leaks during debugging or monitoring.

-bcrypt provides strong password security – It uses salting and computationally expensive hashing to protect against brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

-Logging levels and formatting are highly customizable – Logs can be formatted, filtered, and directed to specific files, enhancing debugging and system monitoring.

-Environment variables protect sensitive credentials – Using .env files or system environment variables helps prevent hardcoded secrets in source code.

-Security is integrated into every layer of development – From authentication to logging and configuration, secure coding practices are essential, not optional.
